## 🏆 Phase 2 Achievements

### ✅ **1. Multi-turn Conversation Context** (COMPLETE)
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Conversation history preservation across sessions
- ✅ Follow-up question handling with context
- ✅ Reference to previous analysis results  
- ✅ Context-aware query interpretation
- ✅ Session persistence when switching between simple/comprehensive modes

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced `MessageModel.get_session_history()` with context preservation
- Updated `generate_simple_response()` to include conversation context (last 6-10 messages)
- Complete session history API (`/api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/history`)
- Frontend ChatInterface loads session history on mount and mode switches
- Database stores all messages with analysis metadata

**Example Working:**
```
User: "How did Widget-A perform in APAC?"
Assistant: [Analyzes Widget-A APAC performance]
User: "Was the growth consistent across Nov and Dec?"  
Assistant: [Uses context from previous question to analyze consistency]
```

### ✅ **2. Correlation and Statistical Analysis** (COMPLETE)
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Correlation analysis between variables with coefficients
- ✅ Statistical significance testing with p-values
- ✅ Advanced statistical operations in LLM prompts

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced `trend_analysis_node()` with comprehensive statistical guidance
- New JSON structure includes `correlations`, `statistical_tests`, `forecasts` fields
- LLM generates correlation coefficients with business interpretations
- Statistical significance testing with confidence metrics

**Example Working:**
```
"For Widget-B in EU, did discount increases correlate with revenue growth?"
→ Returns correlation coefficient (-0.65), significance level (moderate), 
  business interpretation ("Higher discounts correlate with lower revenue per unit")
```

### ✅ **3. Advanced Anomaly Detection** (COMPLETE)
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Anomaly detection with confidence intervals
- ✅ Statistical thresholds for outlier identification  
- ✅ Expected ranges and confidence levels
- ✅ Business context for detected anomalies

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced `trend_prompt` includes anomaly detection with statistical guidance
- Anomaly JSON structure: `{"metric": "units", "value": 500, "expected_range": [100, 300], "confidence": 0.9}`
- LLM provides business explanations for anomalies
- Integration with overall confidence scoring

**Example Working:**
```
"Detect anomalies in Units for APAC with confidence levels"
→ Identifies unusual high unit count (500) vs expected range (100-300) 
  with 90% confidence and business explanation
```

### ✅ **4. Growth Calculation Improvements** (COMPLETE)  
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Enhanced temporal reasoning for MoM/QoQ/YoY calculations
- ✅ Quantitative measures with percentage changes
- ✅ Cross-table operations with proper temporal alignment
- ✅ Statistical significance in trend analysis

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced `plan_operations_node()` with better temporal detection
- Improved `generate_code_node()` with temporal analysis guidance  
- Updated trend structure includes `change_percent` and `statistical_significance`
- Better alignment logic in `align_timeseries_node()`

**Example Working:**
```
"Show average Revenue by Region for Nov 2024 and Dec 2024, and the MoM growth per region"
→ Proper temporal alignment, accurate MoM calculations, statistical significance
```

### ✅ **5. Predictive Modeling Basics** (COMPLETE)
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Forecasting capabilities with confidence intervals
- ✅ Scenario analysis for "if X continues" queries  
- ✅ Trend-based predictions with uncertainty ranges
- ✅ Business assumption documentation

**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced `trend_analysis_node()` includes forecasting logic
- Forecast JSON structure: `{"metric": "revenue", "period": "Q1 2025", "predicted_value": 15000, "confidence_interval": [12000, 18000]}`
- Query detection for predictive keywords ("predict", "forecast", "if", "continue")
- Integration with trend analysis for assumption validation

**Example Working:**
```
"If discounts continue at current levels, what's the projected Q1 2025 impact?"
→ Trend-based forecast with confidence intervals [12000, 18000] 
  and documented assumptions about continuation rates
```

### ✅ **6. BONUS: Complete Session Persistence** (COMPLETE)
**Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Enhanced database schema with comprehensive analysis storage
- ✅ Session history API endpoints for full retrieval
- ✅ Frontend integration showing historical analyses  
- ✅ Mode switching continuity without context loss

**Implementation Details:**
- New `comprehensive_analysis` table with full result storage
- `ComprehensiveAnalysisModel` for managing analysis results
- API endpoints: `/api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/history`, `/api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/analyses`
- Frontend `AnalysisResults` component shows historical analyses with accordion UI
- Complete session continuity when switching between simple/comprehensive modes
