## üü° Missing Core Features (Required)

### 1. **Enhanced Temporal Reasoning & Cross-Table Operations**
**Current Gap**: Our system can analyze multiple files but lacks sophisticated temporal alignment and cross-table comparison capabilities.

**Required Enhancements**:
- [ ] **`align_timeseries` node**: Proper temporal alignment by month/quarter/year before analysis
- [ ] **Enhanced `plan_operations`**: Better distinction between single-table vs cross-table operations
- [ ] **Temporal query understanding**: "last month", "quarterly trend", "compared to last year"
- [ ] **Growth calculations**: MoM, QoQ, YoY percentage changes
- [ ] **Seasonal pattern detection**: Multi-period trend analysis

**Example Queries Not Fully Supported**:
```
"Show average Revenue by Region for Nov 2024 and Dec 2024, and the MoM growth per region"
"Compare Widget-A performance across Q3 and Q4 2024"
"Detect seasonal patterns across the last 6 months"
```

### 2. **JSON Metadata Processing**
**Current Gap**: System doesn't parse JSON fields in CSV data (e.g., `Meta` column).

**Required**:
- [ ] JSON column detection and parsing
- [ ] Channel analysis from `Meta.channel` field
- [ ] Priority/attribute filtering from JSON metadata
- [ ] Nested JSON field extraction for analysis

**Example Query Not Supported**:
```
"What % of online channel revenue (from Meta.channel) comes from Widget-A in APAC over Nov & Dec 2024?"
```

### 3. **Multi-turn Conversational Context**
**Current Gap**: Each query is processed independently without conversation history.

**Required**:
- [ ] Conversation context preservation
- [ ] Follow-up question handling
- [ ] Reference to previous analysis results
- [ ] Context-aware query interpretation

**Example Multi-turn Not Supported**:
```
Q1: "How did Widget-A perform in APAC?"
Q2: "Was the growth consistent across Nov and Dec?" (referring to Q1 context)
```

### 4. **Advanced Statistical Operations**
**Current Gap**: Limited statistical analysis capabilities.

**Required**:
- [ ] Correlation analysis between variables
- [ ] Anomaly detection with confidence intervals
- [ ] Statistical significance testing
- [ ] Predictive modeling capabilities

**Example Queries Not Fully Supported**:
```
"For Widget-B in the EU, did discount increases correlate with revenue growth?"
"Detect anomalies in Units for APAC with confidence levels"
"If discounts continue at current levels, what's the projected Q1 2025 impact?"
```

### 5. **Sample Data Matching PDF Examples**
**Current Gap**: Our sample data doesn't match the exact structure from the PDF.

**Required**:
- [ ] Create `sales_nov_2024.csv` with exact PDF structure
- [ ] Create `sales_dec_2024.csv` with exact PDF structure  
- [ ] Create `sales_q1_2025.csv` (quarterly aggregated format)
- [ ] Include JSON `Meta` field with channel/priority data
- [ ] Test all PDF example queries with this data

- [ ] **Query suggestion system**: Show example temporal queries
- [ ] **Data visualization**: Charts and graphs for trends
- [ ] **Export functionality**: Download analysis results
- [ ] **Query history**: Previous analysis tracking
- [ ] **Template queries**: Pre-built analysis templates

### 7. **Performance & Scalability Improvements**
- [ ] **Caching layer**: Redis for frequent queries
- [ ] **Async file processing**: Background file parsing
- [ ] **Query optimization**: Smart query planning
- [ ] **Result pagination**: Handle large datasets
- [ ] **Connection pooling**: Database optimization

### 8. **Advanced Analytics Features**
- [ ] **Time series forecasting**: Predictive analytics
- [ ] **Cohort analysis**: Customer/product cohorts
- [ ] **Segment analysis**: Automated customer segmentation
- [ ] **A/B testing framework**: Statistical testing
- [ ] **Machine learning integration**: Pattern recognition

### 9. **Enterprise Features**
- [ ] **User authentication**: Multi-user support
- [ ] **Role-based access**: Admin/user permissions
- [ ] **Audit logging**: Activity tracking
- [ ] **Data governance**: Schema validation
- [ ] **API rate limiting**: Request throttling

## üìã Testing Strategy for Missing Features

### **Validation Approach**:
1. **Create exact PDF sample data** with proper structure
2. **Test each PDF example query** systematically
3. **Verify temporal reasoning** with multi-period data
4. **Validate JSON parsing** with metadata fields
5. **Test multi-turn conversations** for context preservation

### **Success Metrics**:
- [ ] All 4 PDF example queries work correctly
- [ ] Temporal alignment produces accurate MoM/QoQ calculations
- [ ] JSON metadata is properly extracted and analyzed
- [ ] Multi-turn conversations maintain context
- [ ] Statistical operations (correlation, anomalies) work reliably
