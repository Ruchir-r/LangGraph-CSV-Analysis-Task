## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Morning startup
./start_v2.sh

# Development work...
# Upload files at http://localhost:3000/upload
# Test AI chat at http://localhost:3000/chat
# View results at http://localhost:3000/results

# Evening shutdown
./stop_v2.sh
```

### Debugging Session
```bash
# Start with live logs
./start_v2.sh --logs

# Monitor real-time activity
# Backend logs show API requests and LangGraph workflow
# Frontend logs show React component updates and API calls
```
